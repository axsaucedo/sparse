# The effects of sparce and group-feature regression models in portfolio optimization.
## Introduction
This project has been developed for the award of Software Engineering BSc at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom.

This project takes a novel approach on portfolio optimization by applying recently proposed regression models in financial data.

In this project we focus on Index Tracking, and results are measured through the Tracking Error of our models. Our main obective is to find a subset of a market index that behaces as similar as possible to this respective index.

The two main regression families that are considered in this project are sparse and group-feature regression models.

### Sparse Regression Models
* Lasso
* Feature Selection with simple models
  * Absolute Values
  * Conditional-Value-at-Risk (CVaR) Optimization 
  * Norm-Constrained CVaR Optimization

### Group Regression Models
* Group Selection
* Group Lasso
* Sparse Group Lasso

## Installation
The code for this paper depends on two main libraries - namely CVX and SPAMS
